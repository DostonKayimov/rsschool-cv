## Short bio

<p>Presently, I've been working for foreign company "POSCO International Textile" as a supply agent in Purchasing department. Although my bachelor degree is for Electrical Engineering, I found my passion at coding. So, I have been taking courses and trainings at programming languages for a year now. I have learned the basics of HTML, CSS and Python. And just a few month ago, I completed the course "Python for Data Visualization" orginized by US Embassy in Tashkent. My future plan is the mastering two programming languages: JavaScript and Python.</p>
